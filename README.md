# KIHC-affordable-housing-analysis
3/30 update (CC):
- removed zones that don't allow for residential units from ETOD eligible vacant lots
- added feature to filter by zone on the shiny app
- added lots that are ETOD eligible based on bus corridors and added eligible bus corridors to the maps

next steps/notes:
- add buildings that are eligible to rehab in central business district and NE neighborhoods to dashboard

3/28 update (AF):
- found a data source for commerical buildings sales! this website (https://www.crexi.com/properties/IL/Chicago/Industrial?pageSize=60&mapZoom=10) allows you to download a dataset with listings
- Using Maryell and Sarah's assessor data, plotted building for sales by difference in assessed home value between 2000 and 2023 for all of Chicago and then the north and central neighborhoods more specifically
  
notes:
- Is this the measure of gentrification we would want? should percent change be used instead?
- add to dashboard?
