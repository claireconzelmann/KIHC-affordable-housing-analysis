# KIHC-affordable-housing-analysis
3/24 update (CC):
- created cleaning.py which preps the data to create the maps on the dashboard
- created dashboard/app.py, which is a shiny dashboard that shows ETOD eligible city-owned lots that are within existing TIF districts

next steps/notes:
- haven't been able to figure out what major bus corridors qualify for ETOD
- add buildings that are eligible to rehab in central business district and NE neighborhoods to dashboard

3/21 update (AF):
- started exploring options for vacant buildings in CBD and NE. Found a dataset that looks at 311 reports of vacant buildings and plotted it
  
notes:
- currently, it is subsetted to this past year. going to continue to explore ways in which we can use this data and ensure the vacant buildings are actually still vacant
- potentially subsetting the map to zoom in on NE and CBD?
- foreclosed rental properties: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Foreclosed-Rental-Property/yhcw-iu53/about_data
