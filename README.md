# KIHC-affordable-housing-analysis
3/21 update (CC):
- created data exploration.ipynb
- downloaded data
- initial data exploration/mapping
- created 1/2 mile buffers around CTA and Metra stops (ETOD eligible)
- found overlap of TIFs and buffers
- found vacant land in those overlapping regions (over 6,000 vacant lots within existing TIFs and that qualify for ETOD)

next steps/notes:
- haven't been able to figure out what major bus corridors qualify for ETOD
- find vacant buildings in central business district and NE neighborhoods to rehab

3/21 update (AF):
- started exploring options for vacant buildings in CBD and NE. Found a dataset that looks at 311 reports of vacant buildings and plotted it
  
notes:
- currently, it is submitted to the past year. going to continue to explore ways in which we can use this data and ensure the vacant buildings are actually still vacant
- potentially subsetting the map to zoom in on NE and CBD?
