# KIHC-affordable-housing-analysis
3/24 update (CC):
- created cleaning.py which preps the data to create the maps on the dashboard
- created dashboard/app.py, which is a shiny dashboard that shows ETOD eligible city-owned lots that are within existing TIF districts

next steps/notes:
- haven't been able to figure out what major bus corridors qualify for ETOD
- add buildings that are eligible to rehab in central business district and NE neighborhoods to dashboard

3/28 update (AF):
- found a data source for commerical buildings sales! this website (https://www.crexi.com/properties/IL/Chicago/Industrial?pageSize=60&mapZoom=10) allows you to download a dataset with listings
- Using Maryell and Sarah's assessor data, plotted building for sales by difference in assessed home value between 2000 and 2023 for all of Chicago and then the north and central neighborhoods more specifically
  
notes:
- Is this the measure of gentrification we would want? should percent change be used instead?
- add to dashboard?
