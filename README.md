# KIHC Affordable Housing Analysis

This folder contains an analysis conducted for the 2025 Kriesman Initiative Housing Challenge. Our task was to answer the question "Where and how should Chicago build 126,125 affordable housing units in the next 3-5 years." We utilize data from the Chicago Data Portal, the Crexi Commercial Real Estate Database, and the Cook County Assessor's office to answer this question. Our analysis can be replicated by running the code in the below order, or you can visit our dashboard to see our results in an interactive form https://kihc2025.shinyapps.io/chicago-affordable-housing-analysis/
